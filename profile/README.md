We are a group of people training music LLMs~ ðŸ”¥

The development log of our Music Audio Pre-training (m-a-p) model family:
- 17/03/2023: we release two advanced music understanding models, [MERT-v1-95M](https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/MERT-v1-95M) and [MERT-v1-330M](https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/MERT-v1-330M) , trained with new paradigm and dataset. They outperform the previous 
models and can better generalize to more tasks.
- 14/03/2023: we retrained the MERT-v0 model with open-source-only music dataset [MERT-v0-public](https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/MERT-v0-public)
- 29/12/2022: a music understanding model [MERT-v0](https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/MERT-v0) trained with **MLM** paradigm, which performs better at downstream tasks.
- 29/10/2022: a pre-trained MIR model [music2vec](https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/music2vec-v1) trained with **BYOL** paradigm.
